# Geoscience Data Analysis â€“ Remote Sensing

This project explores data analysis techniques in the context of geoscience and remote sensing. Using Python and open-source libraries, the notebook performs regression analysis and visualization on remote sensing data.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is included in the `data/` directory:
- `data_final_task_regression.csv`: A CSV file containing geospatial data for analysis.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## How to Run

1. Clone the repo  
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter  
3. Run all cells (data is already included in the `/data` folder)

## Output

Includes visualizations and regression metrics for geospatial analysis.
